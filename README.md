# CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE-PREDICTION
Prediction of cardiovascular disease by using the dataset coontaining age, BMI , blood pressure , cholesterol  etc

ABSTRACT:

The main objective of our project is to predict if a person has a chance of getting a cardiovascular disease based on the person’s medical examination readings (Age, BMI , Blood pressure , Cholesterol  etc). This is a project for predicting potential cardiovascular disease. The significance of heart disease is increasing as the population ages. Existing modes of diagnosis is typically slow and may have undesirable side effects.
The data collected from patients during medical examination contain some hidden information, which is very useful for making effective decisions. For enhancing the results and making efficient decisions on this big data, some advanced ML techniques are used. We develop an efficient cardiovascular disease prediction using ML and DL models for predicting the risk level of cardiovascular disease. The model uses 11 medical parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, for prediction. The model predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. It derives significant patterns and relationships between the input features and learns the features. After the model is trained it is then used for predicting for the testing data. The obtained results have illustrated that the model can effectively predict the risk level of cardiovascular diseases
